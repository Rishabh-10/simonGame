# simonGame 

## Description
Typically, youâ€™ll have four different tiles, each with a unique colour and sound which is activated when pressed. The sound aids the player in remembering the sequence and the game ends if the player misses a step in the sequence.
We will be using an array to keep track of the pattern that the user has to remember and if the user is able to remember the pattern then a new step is added to the array. If the user creates an incorrect pattern then the game restarts.
